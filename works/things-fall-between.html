    <h1>Things Fall Between</h1>
    <p><em>Things Fall Between</em> is an immersive, long-form ambient performance by Ewan James Knight, originally developed as his MA final project. The piece is structured in six movements, performed with guitar, effects, synthesizers, and electronics.</p>
    <p>Premiered in June 2025, the work explores the sensation of falling — as a metaphor for psychological rupture — and uses layered textures, field recordings, and spatial audio to create an enveloping sound world. A studio version is set for release as a full album later in 2025.</p>
