            His recent work includes scoring the independent game <em>I Dancem Refusant</em> (2024) and its forthcoming sequel, set for release in 2025. 
            He also contributed as a songwriter, producer, and instrumentalist on SIM’s <em>After a Bite</em> (2025).

            Under his solo electronic alias <strong>brainjjus</strong>, Ewan explores atmospheric soundscapes and bio-music techniques, blending organic and digital elements 
            to create emotionally resonant works. His debut immersive piece, <em>Things Fall Between</em>, premieres on <strong>June 29th, 2025</strong>, with a digital release to follow later in the year.
        </p>
        <p>
