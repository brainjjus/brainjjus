    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Ewan Knight</strong> is a musician, producer, and educator based in Sheffield, specialising in immersive sound design and 
        richly textured composition. His work includes soundtracks for independent games and collaborations across a range of genres. 
        As <strong>brainjjus</strong>, his solo electronic project, he blends bio-music techniques, multiple instruments, and digital tools 
        to craft atmospheric and emotionally resonant soundscapes. His debut immersive piece, <em>Things Fall Between</em>, premiered in June 2025 
        and will be released as a full-length album later this year. His debut EP, <em>you might never be in the same room you are listening to this again</em>, 
        is also due for release in late 2025.
