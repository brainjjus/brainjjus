        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Ewan Knight</strong> is a musician, producer, and educator based in Sheffield, specialising in immersive sound design and richly textured composition. 
            His recent work includes composing original soundtracks for independent games and launching his solo electronic project <strong>brainjjus</strong>, 
            which blends bio-music techniques, acoustic instrumentation, and digital processing to craft atmospheric and emotionally resonant soundscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            His debut immersive piece, <em>Things Fall Between</em>, premiered in June 2025 and will be released as a full-length album later this year. 
            He is also preparing the release of his debut EP, <em>you might never be in the same room you are listening to this again</em>, set for release in late 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ewan is one half of the collaborative duo <strong>individual Hotpot</strong> with Nam Joo Hoo. Their experimental performance piece, <em>Gut Feelings</em>, explores themes 
            of bodily tension, sonic discomfort, and involuntary expression through improvisation, ambient electronics, and manipulated vocal textures. 
            The duo has presented the work in both academic and performance contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to his creative work, Ewan is available as a <strong>session musician</strong> and offers <strong>music tuition</strong> in guitar, piano, and music theory 
            to learners of all ages and levels.
