    <h1>Session Work & Backing Tracks</h1>
    <p>I am an experienced multi-instrumentalist, available for session work both live and in the studio. I specialise in electric, acoustic, and classical guitar, but also regularly perform on bass and keys.</p>
    <p>Comfortable across a wide range of genres — including rock, jazz, blues, pop, funk, soul, and classical guitar — I can adapt quickly to different styles and projects. Whether you need tasteful guitar parts, deep grooves, or lush harmonic textures, I’m happy to contribute creatively and professionally.</p>
    <p>In addition to instrumental sessions, I also offer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🎛️ Mixing and mastering assistance</li>
        <li>🎹 Custom backing tracks for solo performers and vocalists</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rates vary depending on the project — please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> to discuss your needs. I’ve provided work for a range of artists and would love to hear about your next idea.</p>
