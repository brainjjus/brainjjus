    <h1>Music Tuition</h1>
    <p>I offer one-to-one and small group lessons in a range of instruments and music subjects, tailored to all ages and experience levels. With over five years of teaching experience, I currently work with Sheffield Music Hub, Seven Hills Tuition, and Sheffield Inclusion Centre.</p>
    <p>Lessons are available in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🎸 Classical, acoustic, and electric guitar (up to Grade 8 and beyond)</li>
        <li>🎹 Piano and keyboard</li>
        <li>🎵 Bass guitar, ukulele, and banjo</li>
        <li>🎧 Music theory and music production (Ableton Live, Pro Tools, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My teaching approach is flexible and student-centred — whether you're preparing for grades, developing original compositions, or simply learning for fun, I aim to make lessons engaging, supportive, and musically rich.</p>
    <p>📍 Based in Sheffield.</p>
